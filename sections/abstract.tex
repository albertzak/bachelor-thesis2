\section*{Abstract}

Erlang/\acrshort{otp} is a programming language and runtime system for building distributed systems with high availability requirements. The Erlang/\acrshort{otp} release process is at odds with the practice of \acrlong{ci}, as assembling a release capable of \acrfull{dsu} requires manual interaction at many steps. Previous work on automating Erlang/\acrshort{otp} Release generation has addressed parts of the process by abstracting the low-level mechanics of the build step, but tasks such as versioning and handling artifacts were left to the developer. This thesis presents a release generation tool designed for hands-off operation as part of a Continuous Integration pipeline. Tight coupling with Git allows reliable identification of releases by discarding numeric versions in favor of commit hashes, and a centralized release store takes care of handling artifacts. Evaluation of a reference implementation on six hosted Continuous Integration providers (\emph{CircleCI, Codeship, Semaphore, Shippable, Travis CI,} and \emph{Wercker}) demonstrates comparable run time and ease of setup.
