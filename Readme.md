Bachelor's Thesis<br>
[UAS Campus Vienna](https://www.fh-campuswien.ac.at/en/)<br>
2017

### What is this about?

This is the first time I attempt to write a somewhat larger work.

Check out the planned outline in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eI1Hk-A-a-q019rSu870DGjGTulVKOvgOHBFYBMnNyw/edit?usp=sharing).

The LaTeX sources are compiled to PDF on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/albertzak/bachelor-thesis), and are automatically uploaded to the [releases page](https://github.com/albertzak/bachelor-thesis/releases) of this repository.


The project's code will live under the [beamup-io organization](https://github.com/beamup-io).

### Why?

- To be held accountable.
- To improve my writing.
